# Trato
“Trato” is an open-source, property management software aimed at property brokers / estate agents to help them facilitate and manage all the current deals and properties they have a knowledge of. We made this as a part of our **Software Engineering** mini project using **Python 2.7 & Tkinter**.

With a great focus on User Experience and Design the software will quickly display the available properties in a particular area to the brokers with respect to the requirements of the customers.

## Unique features of the application:
* Cross platform support – offers operating support for most of the known and commercial operating systems.
* User account – for real estate agents and provide features with respect to their hierarchy in the firm.
*	Search – local search engine based on keywords.
*	FAQ and Help functionality – to help users get on board with the software when using it in the initial stages of their business.


## Working of the application:
Initially, the first screen is the authentication screen where the user has the option to sign in to their accounts. There is an option to skip login too. 
After this, the search query is to be entered, which is the locality in focus, which will retrieve search results from an API. 
The results can be filtered according to more input attributes like number of rooms, amenities, price and more. 
Finally clicking on any of the results will reveal more information about each of the properties. 

## Database:
The database will include all the relevant and required information about the properties like the area (building area and carpet area), the number of Bedrooms, Hall & Kitchen, most important the area the property is situated around and all the details of the previous customers. There may also be a rating system for the property with respect to only the people that have rented the property (if any).
The database will also contain details about the clients that have interacted with the firm and include the client details including their contact and their duration of renting/owning the property.
